# HTML5 getUserMedia Experiments

These files are collected examples of using the getUserMedia JavaScript API (the HTML5 Device API replacement), they're also a project where I can experiment with jquery mobile.

While I don't intend to commit broken code the examples here are very much work in progress and may be untidy.

## Requirements

These demos currently require functionality not implemented in any mainstream mobile browser. There is a special build of opera mobile for android available at http://people.opera.com/richt/release/build/Opera_Mobile_11_LABS_device_orientation_preview_20110323.apk
 which is required to run the code found here.
